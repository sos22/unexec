The unexec hack. Takes a bunch of bits from the current process and
saves them out as an ELF binary which resumes where this process left
off. Use it like this:

int main() {
    ... some complicated initialisation ...
    int r = unexec("some_file", NULL);
    if (r < 0) err(1, "unexec failed");
    else if (r > 0) {
         return 0;
    }
    ... normal program stuff ...
}

And then somewhere else:

    execl("some_file", "some_file", NULL);

Which runs the normal program stuff without having to wait for the
complicated initialisation.

The obvious problem with this is that the program really does start
*exactly* where you left it, so you need to do something special if
you want to get the new program's command line arguments. That's what
the new_environment block is for:

int main() {
    struct new_environment new_env;
    int r = unexec("some_file", &new_env);
    if (r < 0) err(1, "unexec failed");
    else if (r > 0) {
         return 0;
    }
    printf("new argv[1] %s\n", new_env.argv[1]);
}

And then

    execl("some_file", "some_file", "Hello world!", NULL);

will print

    new argv[1] Hello world!


Things which get saved at unexec time:

-- Registers

-- All of memory:

   -- MAP_SHARED mmaps stay MAP_SHARED of the same file
   -- MAP_ANONYMOUS and brk pages turn into MAP_PRIVATE mappings of
      the ELF binary we just wrote.
   -- For MAP_PRIVATE mmaps, unexec checks whether the mmap contents
      match the filesystem content. If they do, it stays MAP_PRIVATE
      of the file. If they don't, it's treated as an ANONYMOUS map.
   -- The stack gets turned into an ANONYMOUS map, populated with a
      pread from the binary we wrote.

   Note that things like the environment and argument blocks get
   restored as part of the stack. Use the new_environment block if you
   care.

   Things like ld.so and libdl can't tell they've been saved and
   restored so continue to work as they did before the unexec.

-- Signal handlers get restored.

-- The pid returned by getpid(). unexec followed by restore does not
   change what getpid() returns, even though you're now running in a
   new process with a new pid. If you fork() the new child will have
   the right pid, but there doesn't seem to be any way to fix the
   parent.

Things which are not saved:

-- File descriptors. That'd be a fairly easy thing to fix if you
   needed it, though.

-- Threads. It'd maybe be possible to add this by having something
   which sends SIGSTOP a signal to every thread telling them to save
   their state and then stop doing anything until we're ready to go
   again? Obvious complication is that the thread ID would change,
   which'd probably confuse libpthread in a fairly major way.

-- Child processes. Anything outside of the current process is kind of
   out of scope for this project.
